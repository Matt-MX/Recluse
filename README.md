# Recluse Client

Maintained by **MattMX**

Recluse client is a client for fabric that supports all versions 1.17 and above
It provides services such as a server, which manages social interaction, and keeps
everything in sync. Help on the project isn't nessescery but is appreciated. Feel free
to ask.

## Modules

We also provide customizable GUIs and modules such as
- Ping display
- Armour HUD
- Teams
- Potion display
- Coords
- Compass
- Waypoints
- Custom Discord RPC

## Launcher

Recluse client has a custom launcher, too! Our launcher lets you manage all your fabric mods by selecting which ones you'd like to play with, instead of having
to drag them around manually. It also keeps you up to date with the latest news and versions of the client, and lets you talk to friendes on it.

## Discord Bot

Recluse also has a discord bot which runs on Java. This bot will let you view the server status, as well as any news or updates we publish. We also have some neat
commands on it such as avatar manipulation, games, economy and player stats!

Recluse bot will not have an API, however you may invite recluse to your server with [this link!](https://www.mattmx.com/recluse-bot/)

## API

An API for Recluse client will probably be avaliable in the near future, which will allow you to make your own mods, and interact with our services.
API documentation will be posted in a seperate repo, keep an eye out!
